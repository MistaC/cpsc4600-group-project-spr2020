Honestly if I see one 4/20 post I'm deleting you off Facebook. I do not wish to associate myself with those who celebrate the consumption of a very DANGEROUS AND ILLEGAL DRUG. Kids should not be glorifying this atrocious habit, especially to consider it a "holiday." Christmas is a holiday. Easter is a holiday. Why? They're both celebrating our lord and saviour Jesus Christ- this is not a holiday. Stay away from the devil's lettuce and it's temptation today guys. Please.
